description: Use when computing realized P&L, dividends, interest, or tax due from a Longbridge (長橋證券) account — for individual income tax on foreign income (个税 境外所得), CRS reporting, accounting, or broker P&L reconciliation. Pulls the official monthly statements via the Longbridge CLI and reconstructs the figures the statement does not provide. Companion to the Futu statement skill.

# Longbridge Statement Tax

## Overview

Longbridge (長橋證券) has an **official command-line tool** (`longbridge`, see
https://open.longbridge.com/zh-CN/docs/cli/). This skill calls `longbridge statement` to
fetch the monthly statements as JSON and turns them into tax-ready CSVs.

Like most brokers, Longbridge statements have **no "已实现盈亏" (realized P&L) section**,
so realized P&L is **reconstructed** here (average-cost) from `stock_trades`, seeded with
the **prior-December closing holdings** (`equity_holdings.cost_price`) so positions carried
into the year are costed correctly. Cash dividends live in **`corps` (corporate actions)**;
financing **interest is in `interests` — a cost you paid, not income**.

This is the companion to **futu-statement-skill** (the other broker). Combine the two
brokers' `已实现盈亏` for the final `财产转让所得` (capital-gains) tax.

## When to Use

- Computing 个税 境外所得: realized capital gains + dividends, kept separate
- CRS / annual account reconciliation
- "How much did I make/lose on Longbridge last year, and how much was dividends?"

## Prerequisite: the official Longbridge CLI

This skill **shells out to `longbridge`** — it never handles your credentials. If the CLI
is missing, the script **offers to install it for you (asks for confirmation first), then
offers to run `longbridge auth login`** — both steps require your y/N confirmation, and it
falls back to printing manual steps if you decline or run non-interactively. Manual setup:

```bash
# install (pick your platform)
brew install --cask longbridge/tap/longbridge-terminal                                   # macOS
curl -sSL https://open.longbridge.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/install | sh        # macOS/Linux
scoop install https://open.longbridge.com/longbridge/longbridge-terminal/longbridge.json # Windows

# authenticate (opens a browser, OAuth)
longbridge auth login

# verify
longbridge statement --type monthly --format json
```

If a CLI call fails with an auth error, the script tells you to run `longbridge auth login`.
Docs: https://open.longbridge.com/zh-CN/docs/cli/ . Python 3.10+. (Note: this uses the **CLI**,
not the Longbridge MCP.)

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 longbridge_tax.py --year 2025 -o out/ --rate 0.90322 --fx-rate USD=7.10
```

`--rate` (optional) is the HKD→RMB year-end 中间价 shorthand. For multi-currency statements,
pass one `--fx-rate CCY=RATE` per currency, e.g. `--fx-rate HKD=0.90322 --fx-rate USD=7.10`.
Amounts are grouped by currency first; RMB/tax columns are filled only when that currency
has a matching rate.

For `--year 2025`, if no rate is passed, the script uses the 2025-12-31 PBOC/CFETS central
parity defaults: `HKD=0.90322`, `USD=7.0288`. Explicit `--rate` / `--fx-rate` values override
the built-in defaults.

`--on-negative-position {flag,exclude,short}` controls how negative/short positions are
handled (default `flag`) — see **Negative positions** below; treat a `flag` run that reports
negative positions as needing user confirmation, not a final answer.

| Output (utf-8-sig) | Contents |
|---|---|
| `longbridge_<YEAR>_成交明细.csv` | stock / option / fund trades; `清算金额` already net of fees |
| `longbridge_<YEAR>_股息利息现金流.csv` | dividends (corps), financing interest, withdrawals |
| `longbridge_<YEAR>_已实现盈亏_按标的.csv` | realized P&L per instrument (average-cost) |
| `longbridge_<YEAR>_账户净值.csv` | per-month asset total (cross-check) |
| `longbridge_<YEAR>_税务汇总.csv` | tax summary by currency: gains / dividends / interest + tax due |

The script prints realized total, dividends and interest so you can sanity-check.

## Negative positions — STOP and confirm with the user

A Longbridge **cash account cannot really short**, so when the reconstruction drives an
instrument to a **negative position**, it almost always means **missing cost basis**, not a
genuine short — e.g. shares transferred in (转入), a sell recorded before its buy, or the
prior-December `cost_price` was `N/A` and got skipped. By default the script computes it as a
symmetric short, **includes it in the totals**, and warns.

**When you (Claude) run the script and see `NEGATIVE_POSITION` on stderr (or a `⚠ 负持仓`
note in `已实现盈亏_按标的.csv`), do NOT silently accept the default number.** Surface it and
let the user choose the口径 before reporting any tax figure:

1. **补成本基础重跑(最准 / recommended)** — the instrument is real but its opening cost is
   missing. Find the correct carried-in cost (prior-year purchase price / transfer-in cost)
   and re-run so the basis is seeded correctly. This is the only option that yields a correct
   realized number.
2. **先排除待核对** — re-run with `--on-negative-position=exclude`; the flagged instrument is
   dropped from the totals and 税务汇总 so a data gap doesn't pollute the tax figure, and it's
   listed separately for manual handling.
3. **确认是做空** — only if the user confirms it is a genuine short, re-run with
   `--on-negative-position=short` to include it without the warning.

Explain which instruments are affected and roughly how much they move the total, then re-run
with the chosen flag (and corrected opening data for option 1). Never report a tax number from
a `flag` run that still has unresolved negative positions without telling the user.

## How it works

1. `longbridge statement --type monthly --start-date <YEAR-1>-12-01 --limit 14` → file keys
   for the 12 months **plus the prior December** (for opening cost basis).
2. `longbridge statement export --file-key <k>` → each month's full JSON.
3. Reconstruct realized P&L (average-cost, long + short) from `stock_trades`, seeded from the
   prior-Dec `equity_holdings`. Realized accrues only when a trade reduces the open position, so
   positions still open at year-end (long or short) contribute 0. A negative position is flagged
   (a cash account can't really short — usually missing cost basis) instead of booking the whole
   sale as profit. Dividends from `corps`; interest from `interests`.

## Statement sections used

| Section | Holds | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `stock_trades` | each trade (`clear_amount` = net of fees, signed) | realized P&L, fees |
| `equity_holdings` | per-holding `cost_price`, quantities (incl. prior-Dec) | opening cost basis |
| `corps` | corporate actions / cash dividends | dividend income |
| `interests` | monthly financing interest (`total` negative = paid) | interest cost |
| `account_balance_changes` | cash movements (withdrawals, etc.) | cash-flow view |
| `asset` | month-end asset total | NAV cross-check |
| `fund_trades` | money-market fund subscribe/redeem | shown; excluded from realized |

## Critical Gotchas

1. **No realized-P&L section** — reconstruct from `stock_trades` (average-cost). Seed the
   opening basis from the **prior-December** statement, or gains on positions bought last
   year are overstated.
2. **`clear_amount` is already net of fees** (signed: BUY < 0, SELL > 0). Per-trade fee =
   `|clear_amount| − trade_amount`.
3. **Dividends are in `corps`, not a "dividend" line.** (In some years `corps` is empty —
   then there were no cash dividends.)
4. **`interests` is a cost you paid** (financing/margin interest), not income.
5. **Money-market funds (`fund_trades`)** are accumulating cash-management vehicles; they
   appear in 成交明细 but are **excluded from the realized-P&L headline** (gain is small and
   the statement gives no fund cost basis). Note it if material.
6. **Capital-gains tax must be combined across accounts.** This skill is Longbridge-only;
   its 税务汇总 shows the standalone figure. Net it against your other brokers (e.g. Futu)
   within `财产转让所得` before computing the final capital-gains tax.
7. **Currencies are not interchangeable.** Keep USD/HKD/etc. in separate buckets for
   average cost, realized P&L, dividends, interest, and RMB conversion. Use `--fx-rate`
   for every currency that needs tax/RMB output.
8. **Default FX rates are year-scoped.** 2025 has built-in PBOC/CFETS 2025-12-31 defaults
   for HKD and USD. Other years need explicit rates until their defaults are added.

## Tax note (个税 境外所得)

Convert each currency to RMB at the year-end 人民币汇率中间价 (`--rate` for HKD, repeated
`--fx-rate CCY=RATE` for other currencies). `财产转让所得` (capital gains,
20%) nets gains/losses within the same market across accounts; `利息股息红利所得`
(dividends, flat 20%) is taxed standalone with no deductions. Confirm netting scope,
foreign-tax credit, fund-income classification, and FX 口径 with a tax advisor.
